# breast-cancer-classification
 applying the machine learning concept on the Breast cancer classification data set.


steps involved:
1) installation of the libararies
2)loading the data set.
3)processing the data set.
4)Separating the data into different features
5)spliting the data into training and testing data
6)standardize the data
7)bulding the neural network
8)visualizing the accuracy and loss
9)accuracy of the model on the data


aim: the project was made in oder to use deep learning model on the breast cancer classification data set and to do the important processing step and make prediction. the .ipynb file is commented well to give a detail understand about the project.
